# Advanced-House-Price-Prediction
Machine learning (ML) can be used to predict house prices by analyzing various factors such as location, size, age, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant features. The data for this analysis can be obtained from publicly available housing datasets or through data scraping from real estate websites.

The first step in using ML for house price prediction is to clean and preprocess the data. This includes removing any missing or irrelevant data, as well as encoding categorical variables such as location and number of bedrooms.

Once the data is cleaned and preprocessed, it can be split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the ML model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

There are several types of ML models that can be used for house price prediction, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Each of these models has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of model will depend on the specific characteristics of the data.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The predictions can be used to help real estate agents and buyers make more informed decisions about the value of a property.

Overall, using ML for house price prediction can be a powerful tool for understanding the housing market and making more accurate predictions about property values.
